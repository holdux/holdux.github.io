                This project aims to decrease this number by detecting risk behaviour and immediatly connecting the

                        treatments. <br><br>

                        Due to <b>time constrains</b> and the <b>sensitivity</b> of this theme, instead of basing my
                        research on the direct input of potential users, I worked with a family member who’s a <b>specialist</b>

                    <b>getting out of a rehab facility</b>. Since they are experiencing a difficult transition
                    period,
                    they are the ones who an app like this one would help the most.<br><br>
                    When a user starts the recovery process, the first recommendation is to <b>avoid people and places
                        related to the addiction</b>. However, it's very hard to do this, especially in a moment of
                    crisis when the pacient is feeling alone and more prone to relapse.</p>
                <p>After this realization, I decided to develop a solution focused on this moment of <b>crisis and
                        solitute</b>, using <b>3 scenarios</b> to consider a few reasons why the crisis begins in the
                    first place. </p>

                <p>Our client worked with us from the beginning of this project and we had <b>weekly meetings</b>
                    to showcase
                    our

        <h1>Learnings</h1>
        <p>This project had many challenges, but the most difficult was to <b>instruct the team on how to do an
                entire
                UX
                process in 6 weeks</b>. <br class="d-lg-none"><br class="d-lg-none">My coworkers didn’t have any
            prior
            experience with UX Design, so <b>I was acting as
                a
                designer and team leader</b> at the same time.
            <br><br>
            Thankfully we were able to understand early on what each member skills and interests were and we
            distributed
            the tasks accordingly, <b>making sure everyone would enjoy</b> and be proud of their participation on
            the
            project.</p>
